# Motivation

The creation of Route Peek was motivated by the desire to provide developers with more choice and flexibility in using tools for route matching in web applications. While solutions like [URLPattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLPattern) and [path-to-regexp](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp) successfully address routing tasks, their syntax and approach are often similar, which limits developers' options. We aimed to offer an alternative that allows solving the same tasks differently, fostering diversity and healthy competition in the frontend world.

We believe that Route Peek will become a valuable tool in developers' arsenals, helping to create new routing solutions in web applications.
